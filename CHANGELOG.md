## [2026-06-13] - Header Generator: Language-Aware Comment Syntax

STUB-TGBBRG. The semantic-header sweep (`populate-coderef --source-headers`) stamped JavaScript block comments onto Python files - a SyntaxError on line 1 of a .py - breaking ~197 Primary-Sources Python files and blocking the indexer.

### Fixed
- **Header generator is now language-aware by file extension.** `HeaderGenerator.formatAsComments` hardcoded the JS block style (`/** ... */`) for every file. Hash-comment languages (`py`/`pyi`/`rb`/`sh`/`bash`/`zsh`/`yaml`/`yml`/`toml`/`r`/`pl`/`tcl`/`mk`/`cfg`/`conf`/`ini`) now receive `#` line comments; C-family files (ts/tsx/js/jsx/go/rust/java/c/cpp/...) keep the block style. Shebang handling unchanged (header inserts after `#!` line 1). Verified end-to-end: a real shebang-prefixed PS Python file stamps and compiles (`py_compile` clean).
- **`hasSemanticHeader` + `stripSemanticHeaders` detect `#`-style headers** so re-stamping a Python file refreshes its header instead of double-stamping (idempotency test added).

## [2026-06-13] — Python Call-Resolution Graph-Integrity Fix

WO-PYTHON-EXPORT-EDGE-VALIDATION-FIX-001 (STUB-M3GE4S). Surfaced re-scanning Primary-Sources (a TS Next.js app with a ~110-file Python data-pipeline subtree): `populate-coderef` failed graph-integrity validation with 220 GI-2 `resolved_edge_endpoint_existence` errors — 100% on Python files — refusing to write artifacts.

### Fixed
- **Cross-language call false-resolution** — the call resolver matched calls purely by callee name, with no language guard. A Python `set(...)` call resolved project-wide to a TypeScript element named `set` (and method-name collisions likewise), producing a `resolved` call edge with a Python-file source and a TS-file target — a dangling cross-language edge. Resolution is now constrained to the **same language family** (`js`/`jsx`/`ts`/`tsx`/`mjs`/`cjs`/`mts`/`cts` are one family; every other extension is its own). Fixed 53 of the 220 errors.
- **Missing file-grain node for call source files** — a resolved call whose caller is a module-level statement (`callerCodeRefId === null`) uses the file-grain node `@File/<sourceFile>` as its edge source, but `buildNodes` only created file-grain nodes for files appearing in `state.elements` or `state.importResolutions` — not call-resolution source files. A Python module-level script calling another Python module thus produced a resolved edge whose source node never existed. `buildNodes` now guarantees a file-grain node for every call-resolution source file. Fixed the remaining 167 errors.
- **Net:** Primary-Sources `populate-coderef` 220 errors → **0**; it scans clean and writes all artifacts (header coverage 93.45% after header stamping). New `__tests__/pipeline/call-resolution-cross-language.test.ts` locks both invariants — the integrity/determinism suite was TS-only, which is why this shipped.

## [2026-06-13] — Semantic Registry 2.0.0 (rawFacts dedup)

WO-REGISTRY-RAWFACTS-DEDUP-001 Phase 1 (STUB-BQDXJ0, roadmap Phase 3; operator ruling A).

### Changed
- **`semantic-registry.json` is now `version: "2.0.0"`** — file-grain raw facts (`imports`/`calls`/`exports`/`headerImports`) are stored ONCE in a top-level `rawFactsByFile` map keyed by file, instead of being duplicated onto every element of the file. Under 1.x this duplication was ~98% of the artifact's bytes. Entries reference their bundle via their `file` field; `rawFactsByFile` is omitted when the pipeline ran without a raw-facts bundle. **Self-scan: 124.4MB → 14.9MB (an 88% cut.)**
- **Registries above 10MB serialize compact** (no pretty-print) — a machine-read-only artifact that size gains nothing from indentation.

**Migration:** the only in-tree consumer is `projections.ts` itself (the writer); a consumer sweep found no in-tree reader of `semantic-registry.json`. External readers must branch on the `version` field — entries no longer carry a `rawFacts` field. Primary-Sources re-ground: 56.8MB → 12.5MB (78% cut).

### Fixed
- **`rag-status` vector-store path** — it defaulted to a never-written `rag-vectors.sqlite` while `rag-index`/`rag-search`/the indexing orchestrator all default to `coderef-vectors.json`, so `rag-status` reported "vectors missing" against a perfectly good index. Now resolves the real default (the `CODEREF_SQLITE_PATH` env override is kept as a legacy alias).

---

## [2026-06-13] — RAG Eval Harness

WO-RAG-EVAL-HARNESS-001 (STUB-4M3KQ9, roadmap Phase 5 gate-opener).

### Added
- **`rag-eval`** — golden-query eval harness: 12 intent-phrased queries (`eval/golden-queries.json`) scored hit@1/hit@5/MRR through the SAME `SemanticSearchService` modules `rag-search` uses (provider/store from `rag-index.json` metadata). File-level scoring keeps the metric stable across chunk-grain changes. Committed baseline (`eval/baseline.json`): hit@1 0.583, hit@5 0.667, MRR 0.639 — every future ranking change (CHUNK-ENRICHMENT, PROVENANCE-RANKING) is now measured against it, not vibed.

---

## [2026-06-13] — MCP v2 Tools

WO-MCP-V2-TOOLS-AND-PS-VALIDATION-001 Phase 1 (STUB-ASC73J, roadmap Phase 4).

### Added
- **`hotspots` tool** — fan-in + fan-out ranking over resolved call/import edges; `src_only` (default true) excludes test-origin edges (the `evidence.testOrigin` tag) and test-file elements so architectural load-bearers rank first. Canonical replacement path for intelligence-server's drifted `handleHotspots`.
- **`cycles` tool** — iterative Tarjan SCC over resolved call/import edges; returns cycle membership (largest first) and a sample in-cycle edge per cycle. First live run found a real 2-element cycle in coderef-core's own graph.
- **`what_exports` tool** — file → exported elements via resolved export edges, with ambiguity envelope on path fragments. Closes the export-edge blind spot in the v1 toolset.
- The MCP surface is now **9 read-only tools**; docs swept (CLI.md, AGENT-CONTRACT.md).

### Fixed
- **`impact_of` export-edge hygiene** — reverse BFS now traverses call+import edges only; a file's export edge no longer counts the containing file as a "dependent" of its own element.

### Added (Phase 2)
- **`diff_impact` tool** — PR blast-radius in one call: maps a git diff (default working tree vs HEAD) to changed elements via index.json line ranges, then unions transitive inbound dependents. Validated live on Primary-Sources (`HEAD~5` → 3 files → 22 elements → 8 dependents).
- **`rag_search` tool** — semantic search over MCP; provider/store read from `rag-index.json` metadata so query embeddings always match the index model; graceful `rag_index_missing` / `embedding_unavailable` envelopes. The surface is now **11 read-only tools**.
- **Primary-Sources validation** — PS repopulated with this core (398 files, 19.9s; 14-field report; `builtin_count` 107 → 665), `.mcp.json` registered for PS, all 11 tools live-smoked there.

### Removed (Phase 3)
- **`coderef-intelligence-server` retired** (operator-delegated ruling A, STUB-9F63EJ): it read legacy edge fields (`e.source`/`e.target`/`e.type`) internally — the schema-drift class the MCP server was built to kill — and a consumer sweep across LLOYD/ASSISTANT/DASHBOARD found zero callers. Source + bin entry deleted; `docs/intelligence-api.md` replaced with a retirement tombstone and endpoint→MCP-tool replacement map.

## [2026-06-13] — Scanner Export Classification Fix

WO-SCANNER-EXPORT-CLASSIFICATION-FIX-001 Phase 1 (STUB-5WVGHD).

### Fixed
- **`isExported` no longer crosses scope boundaries** — the export check walked up through every ancestor, so any nested function/arrow inside an exported parent inherited `exported:true` (e.g. `buildToolHandlers.inboundByKind`), false-staling honest `@exports` headers via the `exports_match_ast` cross-check. The walk now stops at `statement_block`/`class_body`/function boundaries; nested elements are never exported themselves.
- **Exported multi-line const declarations are now extracted** — `isConstantValue` accepted only primitive literals, so `export const X = new Set([...])` (and array/object/call/template/as-const initializers) produced no element at all; `@exports` headers could never list real const exports. The ALL_CAPS name gate keeps the widening flood-safe. Self-scan: +~80 constant elements (126 total, 30 exported).
- **25 `@exports` headers restamped** to the corrected AST ground truth (under-listing const exports / listing nested closures like `addEntry`); 9 newly-visible files stamped. Header baseline is now fully clean: `header_stale_count` 0, `header_export_mismatch_count` 0, coverage 99.27%.
- **vitest collection failure on shebang+CRLF `.mjs` scripts** (Phase 2, STUB-Z1ETZD): vitest's shebang stripping leaves the stray `\r` when the shebang line ends CRLF, so any test importing `scripts/check-header-coverage.mjs` died at collection with `SyntaxError` (plain node import worked). LF-normalized the script and pinned `scripts/*.mjs text eol=lf` in `.gitattributes`. `check-header-coverage.test.ts` collects and passes for the first time.
- **rag-index deletion sweep** (Phase 3, STUB-81XNNM): the mtime stale-check could not see files *deleted* after the last populate — they only surfaced as per-chunk ENOENT errors hours into an embedding run (17 ghosts, 9.7h into the 2026-06-12 full-repo dogfood). `IndexingOrchestrator` now sweeps the graph's distinct files for disk existence at graph load and surfaces staleness at minute zero via the additive `IndexingResult.staleIndexWarning` field + an upfront console warning. Warn-only — per-chunk behavior unchanged.

## [2026-06-12] — Import-Resolver Membership Fix (NodeNext `.js` → `.ts`)

WO-IMPORT-RESOLVER-MEMBERSHIP-CHECK-BUG-001 Phases 1–2 (STUB-XK82Z2 + STUB-QT400D, from the unresolved-edge audit).

### Fixed
- **`probeRelative` now maps NodeNext emitted-extension specifiers onto TS sources** (`./x.js` → `x.ts`/`x.tsx`, `.mjs` → `.mts`, `.cjs` → `.cts`, `.jsx` → `.tsx`), with exact on-disk matches still taking precedence. Previously every relative import written NodeNext-style (`import ... from './x.js'` referring to `x.ts`) was misclassified `unresolved`/`relative_target_not_in_project` — 833 false unresolved edges on coderef-core's own graph, of which 812 now resolve (the remaining 21 point at genuinely-unscanned files like `dist/` output). Self-scan baseline: `valid_edge_count` 4293 → 5226, `unresolved_count` 20701 → 20243.
- **Node builtins now classify `builtin` instead of `unresolved`/`ambiguous`** (Phase 2, STUB-QT400D — no locked-enum changes):
  - Bare and `node:`-prefixed builtin imports (`path`, `node:fs/promises`, …) classify `external` with `reason='node_builtin'`; graph-builder maps the pair onto `resolutionStatus='builtin'` (`not_in_manifest_or_node_modules` 487 → 21).
  - Calls on receivers bound to builtin-module imports (`import * as path from 'path'; path.join()`) classify `builtin` with `reason='builtin_module_receiver'`.
  - Bare calls to JS/Node globals (`parseInt`, `setTimeout`, …) classify `builtin` with `reason='js_global_callee'` — only when nothing in the project shadows the name (symbol table always wins).
  - `BUILTIN_RECEIVERS` grew per DR-PHASE-4-A with paired tests: `console`, `process`, `globalThis`, `Buffer`, `WeakMap`, `WeakSet`, `Proxy`, `BigInt`, `Intl`, `Atomics`.
  - Self-scan: `builtin_count` 1186 → 4622, `unresolved_count` 20243 → 17484, `ambiguous_count` 3204 → 2620.

### Added
- **Test-origin edge tagging + src-only validation counts** (Phase 3, STUB-K5YBFN, operator-ruled option A): graph-builder stamps an additive `evidence.testOrigin: true` on every edge whose `sourceLocation.file` matches `__tests__|.test.|.spec.` — graph semantics unchanged (statuses, ids, and totals untouched). `ValidationReport` grew additively 12 → 14 fields: `unresolved_src_count` + `ambiguous_src_count` count edges NOT tagged test-origin, separating test-framework noise from src truth. Self-scan: 66.6% of unresolved is test-origin; src-only unresolved is 5,854 (vs 17,526 total). Locked-schema test, MCP server, and docs swept 12 → 14.
- **`evidence.probableBuiltinMember` flag** (Phase 4, STUB-XX4JBC, operator-ruled option A): `receiver_not_in_symbol_table` call edges whose callee is JS prototype vocabulary (`push`/`map`/`join`/`split`/… — `JS_PROTOTYPE_METHODS` in call-resolver) carry an additive `probableBuiltinMember: true` evidence hint so consumers can sub-count probable builtin member calls. The edge stays `unresolved` — no `EdgeResolutionStatus` enum change. Self-scan: 5,869 flagged (4,735 src-only, vs the audit's 4,863 estimate).

## [2026-06-12] — MCP Server + Local-First RAG

WO-CODEREF-CORE-MCP-SERVER-AND-INTELLIGENCE-FIXES-001 (with header-coverage groundwork from WO-RAG-HEADER-COVERAGE-ENFORCE-AND-SURFACE-001).

### Added
- **`coderef-mcp-server`** — MCP stdio server exposing `.coderef/` intelligence as 6 read-only tools (`what_calls`, `what_imports`, `impact_of`, `find_element`, `codebase_summary`, `validation_status`). Registered as the `coderef-core` MCP domain via `.mcp.json`; new bin entry in `package.json`. Typed against `ExportedGraph` so graph-schema drift fails at compile time. Artifact cache with mtime invalidation; resolved-edges-only traversal; ambiguity envelope returns ≤5 candidates instead of guessing.
- `rag-index --include-headerless` — embed chunks from header-less elements (`headerStatus` ∈ {missing, stale, partial}) with `header:false` provenance instead of skipping them, enabling RAG on repos that were never header-annotated. Skip-with-reason (DR-PHASE-7-E) remains the default. `CodeChunkMetadata` gains an optional `header` boolean.
- `rag-index --coverage-floor <0-100>` / `--strict-coverage` — header-coverage gate (warn or refuse below floor), surfaced in `--help` (flags shipped earlier via WO-RAG-HEADER-COVERAGE-ENFORCE-AND-SURFACE-001).
- `header_coverage_pct` — 12th field of the locked `ValidationReport` (additive), surfaced by `populate-coderef` and `rag-index` output.

### Changed
- **Embedding provider default is now key-aware**: `openai` only when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, otherwise `ollama`/`nomic-embed-text` (local-first). Applies identically to `rag-index` and `rag-search` so query embeddings always match the index model. Cloud embedding is opt-in, never a silent default.
- `docs/CLI.md` — rewrote `rag-index`/`rag-search` option tables to match the shipped flag surface (stale `--dir`/`--chroma-url`/`--model`/`--query`/`--threshold` flags removed; `--constraint` documented as shipped, not deferred); added `coderef-mcp-server` section.

---

## [2026-05-05] — Phase 8: Documentation Update

### Documentation
- Rewrote `docs/SCHEMA.md` as the canonical schema reference with sibling sections for Scanner Schema (`ElementData`), Relationship Schema (raw facts + resolved relationships), Resolution Statuses (`ImportResolutionKind` 7 values, `CallResolutionKind` 5 values, `EdgeResolutionStatus` 8 values), Graph Schema (8-field `GraphEdgeV2`, 10-variant `EdgeEvidence`, `GraphNode` with Phase 7 facet propagation, `ExportedGraph`), Validation Report (11-field locked Phase 6 contract), and Indexing Result (Phase 7 additive shape with `IndexingStatus` thresholds, `SkipReason`, `FailReason`).
- Created `docs/HEADER-GRAMMAR.md` as a citation-mirror of the canonical BNF at `ASSISTANT/SKILLS/ANALYSIS/analyze-coderef-semantics/SKILL.md`. CORE never forks the grammar.
- Rewrote `docs/API.md` to cover the post-rebuild public surface, stability commitments, Phase 6 validation gate, Phase 7 indexing contract, and the explicit `What NOT to import` boundary.
- Rewrote `AGENTS.md` as the canonical CORE-side agent usage contract: validation-report.json gate, IndexingResult.status semantics, rag-index exit codes, what-not-to-read, version compatibility commitments, with footer pointer to `ASSISTANT/PROJECT-CONTEXT/coderef-core/CONTEXT.md` for general project rules. `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` remain unchanged 5-line pointer stubs (Path C ruling, 2026-05-05).
- Updated `docs/CLI.md` to document `--strict-headers` (Phase 6) on `populate-coderef`, the validation-gate behavior + `IndexingResult.status` exit codes on `rag-index`, and `--layer` / `--capability` filter flags (Phase 7) on `rag-search`.
- Updated `docs/rag-http-api.md` with Phase 7 reality: `IndexingResult.status` field on responses, `validationGateRefused` semantics, per-entry `SkipReason` / `FailReason` enum, `--layer` / `--capability` query passthrough.
- Rewrote `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` as a phase-ordering overview (Phases 0–7) with `ExportedGraph` canonical and `DependencyGraph` marked `@legacy`.
- Archived 4 audit-style root markdown to `docs/archive/<file>-2026-05-05.md` with dated banners (DR-PHASE-8-A): `EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY`, `CODEREF-ANALYSIS-REPORT`, `DUPLICATE-FILES-AUDIT`, `GENERATE_FOUNDATION_DOCS_ALIGNMENT_PLAN`. Archived `docs/coderef-semantic-schema.md` (predates Phase 1+2.5; superseded by `docs/SCHEMA.md`).

### Pipeline Rebuild Complete (Phase 0..7)

The 9-phase pipeline rebuild is complete. Per-phase archives are at `coderef/archived/pipeline-*/ARCHIVED.md`:

| Phase | Slug | Outcome |
|------:|------|---------|
| 0 | `pipeline-graph-ground-truth-tests` | 6 ground-truth assertions PASS |
| 1 | `pipeline-scanner-identity-taxonomy` | canonical `codeRefId`, `ElementData.layer/capability/constraints/headerStatus` |
| 2 | `pipeline-relationship-raw-facts` | `RawImportFact` / `RawCallFact` / `RawExportFact` (endpoints never node IDs) |
| 2.5 | `pipeline-semantic-header-parser` | `@coderef-semantic:1.0.0` parser; `HeaderFact` per file |
| 3 | `pipeline-import-resolution` | `ImportResolution[]` with 7-value `ImportResolutionKind` |
| 4 | `pipeline-call-resolution` | `CallResolution[]` with 5-value `CallResolutionKind` |
| 5 | `pipeline-graph-construction` | 8-field `GraphEdgeV2`, 10-variant `EdgeEvidence`, `ExportedGraph` canonical |
| 6 | `pipeline-output-validation` | `validatePipelineState` chokepoint, 11-field `ValidationReport`, `--strict-headers` |
| 7 | `pipeline-indexing-rag` | `IndexingResult.status`, refuse-on-`ok=false`, `SkipReason` / `FailReason`, `--layer` / `--capability` filters, file-grain worst-severity facet aggregation |

Final post-Phase-7 baseline: `valid_edge_count=3464`, `header_missing_count=262`, all other validation counts `0`, ground-truth 6/6 PASS. Phase 8 archives the rebuild as a documentation pass with zero source code changes.
